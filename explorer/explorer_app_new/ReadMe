some problem 
QQ :499174318



pay attention to CMakeLists.txt and package.xml
plugin.xml is to load the plugin class 
the .py file in the "scripts" document is to launch this appliacation (!---change permission to 0777----)
the setup.py is needed by the CMake

!-----
(make sure that qt-creator has installed in your computer!!)
the way to generate ui*.h
is "uic-qt4 *.ui -o ui_*.h"
(with same function,by command "uic","uic2","uic3",but best choose is "uic-qt4")
(try "sudo apt-get" to get it)
